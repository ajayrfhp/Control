# Goal
- Build a control agent that chooses players to optimize FPL reward score for English premier league seasons
a
# Baseline
- Implement a random selection agent that randomly picks players within the allocated budget. 

## Design philosophy
- Is primarily just for fun
- Is secondarily a learning exercise on building data pipelines and building models that act on real world signals. 
- Meant to be an iterative effort over the years
- Always show prediction evaluation and baseline comparison
- Bonus goal
  - Be better than the random agent

## What is the type of data available ?
- We know values obtained by players in the previous seasons against various opponents
